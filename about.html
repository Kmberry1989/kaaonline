                    <p class="mb-6">The Kokomo Art Association was organized in 1926 to interest the community in the Arts. Meetings were first held in members' homes and at the Hotel Frances in downtown Kokomo. Early on, the group sponsored the Hoosier Salon and brought many fine exhibits to Kokomo. A constitution was written and by-laws were established in 1962. Not-for-profit status was attained in 1981. With the help of a grant from the Indiana Arts Commission, the Kokomo Art Association was able to purchase the Seiberling Mansion, now the Howard County Museum, as its first permanent home in 1972.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">In 1962, KAA received as a gift the present Kokomo Art Center at 525 West Ricketts Street (in Highland Park) from the late Mrs. John E. Fredrick. The building, a carriage house on the grounds of a home once owned by a son of one of the city's founders, David Foster, was remodeled into a gallery and classroom space with a small apartment for a resident artist. The apartment is now used for additional classroom space, a library, and a children's hands-on art room. A pottery lab was also added.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6">In 2010, the opportunity arose to rent and later purchase a second location in downtown Kokomo at 210 North Main Street, which is now known as Artworks Gallery. This gallery provides a place for over 40 local artists to display and sell their work. It also provides a venue for monthly special exhibits and events, such as the popular First Friday gatherings.</p>
                    <p>The Kokomo Art Association is proud to be a vibrant part of the local arts community, offering two distinct locations to experience and engage with art. We continue to fulfill our mission to promote the arts, support local artists, and provide creative opportunities for the entire community.</p>
