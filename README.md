# Kokomo Art Association Website

This repository contains a basic static website for the Kokomo Art Association.

The `index.html` file uses Tailwind CSS and includes several interactive
features such as modals, an events calendar and responsive navigation.

## Additional Layout Options

Two alternative versions of the homepage are provided for comparison.

- **index_bootstrap.html** – A variant built with Bootstrap 5. It keeps the
  same core content but uses Bootstrap components for a different look and feel.
- **index_simple.html** – A minimal dark themed version with custom CSS and a
  simplified layout.

All versions are mobile friendly and can be viewed directly in the browser.

To try a version, open the corresponding HTML file in your web browser.
